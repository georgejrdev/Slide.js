<p style="text-align:center">Implement a slide in a simple, light and direct way.</p>


## Objective:

Have you wanted to add a slideshow to your website and found yourself with libraries full of dependencies and with difficult and limited configuration/customization?

Use pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create an easy, lightweight and functional slideshow.

You won't have a surprise dependency if you don't have any.

## How to use:

- Go to original code stored in [use.html](./use.html).
- Copy css code.
- Copy html code.
- Copy javascript code.

You can separate and organize the files however you want, as long as the css and javascript are properly linked to the html.

- Add the divs that should be moved inside #slide-content.

ATTENTION: The added divs MUST have the content class.
